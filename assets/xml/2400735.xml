<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by increasing the number of chemical technicians prepared to work in a variety of important industries, including the rapidly growing battery and semiconductor sectors, where they develop, test, and manufacture chemicals and materials. New York State employment projections predict a statewide increase of 13.1% in the number of available chemical technician jobs over the next ten years. To meet this growing demand for skilled technicians, this project will support the creation of a hybrid Associate of Applied Science program in chemical technology. As laboratory techniques are critically important for chemical technicians, an in-person lab experience in the form of hands-on boot camps will be implemented. Additionally, the project will support student internship opportunities with industry partners, as well as priority job application status upon graduation. Ultimately, this team of researchers aim to broaden participation of students from underrepresented groups in the chemical technician workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal goal of this project is to design and create a hybrid chemical technology Associate of Applied Science degree program in order to accommodate workforce needs. To achieve this goal, the following four objectives will be achieved: 1) provide a flexible pathway to a career in chemical technology that meets the needs of students who are unable to take classes in a traditional format; 2) create and promote activities that focus on recruiting women and underrepresented minorities to enroll; 3) expand partnerships with area businesses to provide internships and hands-on learning experiences for students; and 4) provide students who successfully complete the degree with employment opportunities and priority job application status with industry partners. Project success will be measured using institutional data and surveys of students and industry partners. Results, including program design and curriculum, will be disseminated through ATE Central, regional partners, and national conferences. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
