<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2024, Broadening Participation of Groups Underrepresented in Biology. The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Global biodiversity loss can have cascading effects for dependent species so that declines in one species negatively impact the other. Seed dispersal is important in many plants, and they produce fruit to attract animals that spread the seeds. Yet, little is known about how plants respond to the loss of their animal dispersers. This project investigates the consequences of wild bird loss on the chilies (fruits) they disperse in the Mariana Islands. The introduction of an invasive snake species on the southernmost island (Guam) has decimated native bird populations; however, the snakes are not present on other islands, and these have native birds.  The research aims to improve understanding of how plant species respond to global change by comparing differences in fruiting on islands with and without birds. Further, by focusing on a culturally important plant in the Marianas, the fellow has excellent opportunities to provide outreach to communities already impacted by ecosystem change and accessible research participation and mentorship for prospective scientists in geographically isolated locations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to answer the following: Q1) In islands with varying seed disperser density, are there differences in frugivore visitation and fruit traits in wild C. frutescens populations? (Q2) What is the genetic and environmental contribution to fruit trait variation in Mariana C. frutescens populations? (Q3) How do individual C. frutescens from different island populations respond to low disperser activity? To approach these questions, the fellow will measure natural variation in physiological and chemical fruit traits in C. frutescens populations across the Marianas (Q1), grow individual C. frutescens from different islands in a common garden experiment (Q2), and assess the impacts of manipulated fruit removal rates on fruit traits of C. frutescens plants from different islands (Q3). The fellow will be trained in relevant fieldwork and chemical analysis techniques to conduct these activities, mentoring undergraduate students at the host institution and the Marianas to facilitate research. The fellow will also engage in outreach activities in the Marianas, including classroom presentations and informational booths at agricultural events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
