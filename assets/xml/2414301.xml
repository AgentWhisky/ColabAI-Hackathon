<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Description:&lt;br/&gt;This project explores how light interacts with soft matter, such as liquids containing colloidal particles, to create new structures. By using light, these particles can be made to form unique configurations with special properties significantly changing how light interacts with them. One major goal is to develop "transient photonic devices," which can self-assemble and disassemble in response to light. These devices are stable and reconfigurable when illuminated and disappear when the light is off. This research is important for advancing optical science and has practical applications in various fields, such as new technologies for controlling light. The project also includes efforts to share findings with the public through online tutorials and demonstrations, making the science accessible and interesting to everyone. Additionally, the project emphasizes education by providing hands-on learning experiences for students and engaging underrepresented groups in science and engineering, ensuring a diverse and inclusive participation. By partnering with organizations such as Indigenous Hispanic African-American Women KU Engineering (IHAWKe), the project aims to inspire a broader audience and cultivate interest in the field of photonics, ultimately contributing to a more diverse STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on the fundamental science of light interacting with soft matter on a mesoscopic scale, using principles from statistical physics and nonlinear optics. The main objective is to redefine optically guided assembly by understanding and manipulating the interaction between light and colloids. This will create a versatile framework for developing advanced optical materials with enhanced properties. The innovations from this research are expected to benefit the field of optical manipulation and biomedical optics, potentially leading to new diagnostic tools and improved imaging techniques. The project will explore controlling the extreme nonlinearity of colloidal nanosuspensions for applications like optical limiting, spatial light modulation, and real-time holography. It aims to demonstrate the practical value of creating soft-matter "transient photonic devices," where light controls the structure in real time. This research will also benefit other fields, such as chemistry and biology, by allowing precise optical control of particle concentrations. Educationally, the project will train students in optical measurement techniques and integrate research concepts into university courses, promoting interest and diversity in photonics through outreach activities and collaborations with organizations such as Indigenous Hispanic African-American Women KU Engineering (IHAWKe). Additionally, the project will produce and share simulation software on platforms such as nanohub.org, further extending its impact on both scientific and public communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials (EPM) program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
