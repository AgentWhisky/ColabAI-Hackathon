<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The annual Computer-Human Interaction (CHI) conference has for years been the leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research and practice related to human-computer interaction.  This award will support student travel to the CHI doctoral consortium, to be held at the beginning of the conference on May 11-12, 2024, in Honolulu, HI.  The doctoral consortium has been an annual event since 1986 that has helped launch the careers of many outstanding HCI researchers.  It is a research-focused workshop that provides researchers and career guidance for a group of selected highly promising PhD students and a panel of distinguished research faculty.  To build a cohort of future scholars and provide high quality feedback to students, the workshop will consist of two days of student presentations followed by feedback from a panel of experts. Further, during two conference sessions, student participants will present posters to discuss their work with interested attendees. The work of these consortium participants is thus showcased to the entire CHI conference, and the students have an opportunity to receive feedback from a large audience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will provide travel support to about 8 students who otherwise have limited travel funding and so might not be able to attend.  Criteria for selection include appropriate timing in the student's career and dissertation project, the value the student will both receive and bring to the consortium, and the need for travel funding.  In alignment with the consortium's overall goal to increase diversity of perspectives within the CHI community, the selection committee will also seek to fund students from a wide range of personal, professional, disciplinary, and institutional backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
