<AbstractNarration>The past thirty years have seen a deep and surprising interplay between several branches in pure mathematics, and string theory in physics. In particular, physical predictions have led to the development of mathematical invariants which count algebraic curves in spaces, and conversely, the mathematical study of these invariants has led to advances in string theory. This project further develops two curve counting techniques, the "logarithmic gauged linear sigma model" (log GLSM) and "quasimaps", and their combination, with the goal of making progress on challenging conjectures from physics, which have appeared out of reach of mathematicians until recently. This project will offer ample training opportunities for graduate students and postdocs. In addition, the PI will organize a yearly intensive weekend learning workshop on a topic of interest, as well as organize events aiming to counter stereotypes in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the project will result in a proof of the localization formula for log GLSM, which is of utmost importance for the application of this technique. In addition, effective invariants, which are a major ingredient of the localization formula, will be studied. In a different direction, the PI will explore applications of log GLSM to the tautological ring, to establish structural predictions observed in physics, such as the "conifold gap condition", for the quintic threefold and other one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds, and to establish the Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence for quintic threefolds in all genera. With regard to quasi-maps, the second main technique employed in this project, the PI will use quasi-maps for explicit computations of Gromov-Witten invariants of non-convex complete intersections. Quasi-maps appear necessary for approaching some of the more mysterious predictions from physics, and hence log GLSM will be extended to allow for quasi-maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
