<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The ACM Sigmetrics 2024 conference will occur jointly with IFIP Performance conference, which is the flagship conference of the IFIP working group WG7.3 on performance modeling and analysis. Every 3 years or so, the two conferences join, and the 2024 edition is the 16th joint conference. The ACM Sigmetrics / IFIP Performance 2024 will be held at San Servolo Congress Center, Venice, Italy between June 10-14,2024. The SIGMETRICS conference is primarily focusing on the performance analysis, measurement, and modeling of networked computer systems. ACM SIGMETRICS is one of the top venues for researchers to exchange scientific information and ideas. ACM SIGMETRICS aims to provide a high-quality forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further our knowledge and understanding of the measurement, modeling, analysis, and design of computing and networked systems. The conference interprets computer systems broadly, including traditional computing systems as well as social networks, data networks, and other types of systems. Contributions containing highly original ideas, new approaches, and/or ground-breaking results are particularly encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides travel support for about 25 US based students to attend the SIGMETRICS 2024 conference. The support will make possible the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference. Particular attention will be paid to directing support towards various underrepresented population. SIGMETRICS brings together professionals from a wide variety of academic and industrial backgrounds; student participants will thus get the opportunity to interact with mentors and peers of varying gender, ethnicity, and background. Students will also benefit from the student-centric events, including a student workshop/panel and a student research competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
