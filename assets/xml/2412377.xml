<AbstractNarration>Neutrinos are among the most abundant particles in the Universe and yet scientists do not know two of their key properties: their mass and whether they are their own antiparticle. Because of their abundance, even a tiny neutrino mass could have far-reaching consequences. Knowing if neutrinos are their own antiparticles informs why our universe has so much matter and very little antimatter, which in turn address why the familiar material reality surrounding us exists at all. It may also help scientists understand the very source of neutrino mass, which is currently a great mystery. Neutrinoless double beta decay is an as-yet-detected nuclear decay that is remarkably sensitive to these unknown neutrino properties; attempting to characterize this decay informs scientists about these core questions. With this project, Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo undergraduate students and their faculty mentor will have the exciting opportunity to be involved the international CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) and CUPID (CUORE Upgrade with Particle Identification) experiments in the search for neutrinoless double beta decay. They will Learn by Doing, travel abroad, and work hands-on with these cutting-edge projects by helping to improve the detectors and analyze data. Undergraduate research opportunities such as this allow students to contribute to important science and generate formative experiences for early technical careers. This ultimately contributes to a competent and competitive US technical workforce and seeds a generation of future scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CUORE is a well-established bolometry experiment to search for neutrinoless double beta decay and other rare events in 130-Te. CUORE has been taking data since 2017 at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Assergi, Italy. It is an array of TeO_2 crystals used as cryogenic bolometers for the purpose of particle detection. CUPID is a next-generation experiment undergoing R&amp;D; it fits well into the suite of future developments of the field by increasing sensitivity to rare events such as neutrinoless double beta decay. In particular, CUPID uses both the bolometric and scintillating properties of Li_2MoO_4 crystals to search for neutrinoless double beta decay in 100-Mo. Cal Poly students will assist in efforts to transition from CUORE and CUPID operations. Moreover, they will participate in data analysis and remote shifts for CUORE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
