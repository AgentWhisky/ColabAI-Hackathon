<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of a non-invasive, easily accessible, user-friendly technology for tooth decay prevention and treatment. Tooth enamel cannot naturally remineralize or repair itself once eroded or damaged, and current dental restorative treatments are invasive and remove a certain amount of healthy tooth structure. Contemporary dental restorative materials differ in composition and properties from enamel and dentin, failing to integrate into the tooth structure and leading to vulnerable interfaces that contribute to recurrent tooth decay and eventual tooth loss. Tooth decay prevalence in adults has been increasing in the United States, with 96% of individuals aged 50 to 64 experiencing tooth decay. Furthermore, about 60% of American children have had a tooth decay by the age of 5 and 46% of youth aged 2-19 years have tooth decay. Overall, the broad applicability of regenerative tooth enamel has the potential to significantly improve the dental health of all Americans by offering a minimally invasive, durable treatment for patients suffering from tooth disease. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of a novel formula to regenerate tooth enamel. This innovative approach focuses on restoring the original tooth structure and preventing decay by generating synthetic tooth enamel, closely resembling natural enamel. This formula contains all of the essential active ingredients in optimal proportions, ensuring the seamless integration of new synthetic enamel into the existing tooth structure. Prior research established the validity of the innovation through lab testing, demonstrating the technologyâ€™s ability to generate continuous enamel growth on both enamel and dentin surfaces, as well as integrate into existing tooth structures, even in the presence of bacteria. Distinguished by its non-invasive method of restoration, this technology has the potential to conserve healthy tooth structure, minimizing the needs for drillings, extractions, crowns, and root canal treatments, thus significantly preserving natural teeth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
