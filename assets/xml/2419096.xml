<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of wheelchair-mounted assistive robots with a semi-autonomous control system.  Currently, powered wheelchair users who face challenges due to limited or no upper limb functions rely on manual assistance from caregivers, basic assistive devices, such as reachers, and/or joystick-controlled assistive robots. While these solutions provide some function, they fail to provide the desired level of independence and often lack technological sophistication. This technology is designed to assist with performing essential activities of daily living such as eating, manipulating objects, and opening or closing doors semi-autonomously. The technology may address critical personal and societal needs by empowering individuals with mobility impairments, providing an intuitive and precise user experience, and thereby improving their quality of life and reducing dependence on caregivers. In addition, it may be possible to use the semi-autonomous control system in other robotic applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a semi-autonomous control system for wheelchair-mounted assistive robots. This technology uses advanced vision control and image processing, including depth cameras, to provide real-time environmental data on an easy-to-use touchscreen. This integration enhances spatial awareness and interaction capabilities. In addition, the system includes integration of natural language processing, enabling intuitive and precise operation that surpasses the performance of existing technologies. This solution allows for semi-automatic control of assistive robots, helping with daily tasks like eating, reaching objects, and opening or closing doors. The technology may help to address crucial needs by empowering individuals with mobility impairments to lead more independent lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
