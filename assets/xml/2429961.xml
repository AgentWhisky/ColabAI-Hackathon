<AbstractNarration>WiGRAPH is an ACM SIGGRAPH Community Group that aims to broaden the network of women researchers in Computer Graphics.  Its mission is to increase the number of women pursuing cutting-edge research in the field by creating supportive environments where women researchers can interact with each other and seek role models, mentorship, and encouragement.  WiGRAPH offers a range of opportunities, including research panels, networking spaces, and an online article series that highlights the journeys and accomplishments of inspiring women researchers.  The Rising Stars program is a series of workshops designed to empower women who are finishing their PhD and about to enter the job market, providing them with resources that can help them pursue research careers in the field and achieve their goals, thereby creating a more inclusive and diverse research community that can drive innovation and progress in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is designed to empower and inspire young women in Computer Graphics research.  Through a series of workshops and panels, it provides practical advice on how to pick research topics, pursue research questions, and navigate the industry/academic markets. This is particularly important for women researchers, especially those from underrepresented groups, who face unique challenges and obstacles in their careers. The program includes a range of workshops covering topics such as networking, negotiation, and career development, all of which are relevant to women researchers.  Participants also have the opportunity to network with each other and build relationships with potential mentors and sponsors, creating a supportive community that can help women researchers thrive.  Overall, the program provides women researchers with the tools they need to succeed, whether in industry or academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
