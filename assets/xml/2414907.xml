<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award supports up to sixteen US-based researchers in mathematical logic to attend the Twentieth Simposio Latino Americano de Logica Matematica, which will take place in Piriapolis, Uruguay, on July 1-5, 2024.  These logicians, all based at universities in the USA, will include doctoral students, early-career researchers, and senior scholars in the discipline of logic.  Many of them will give presentations about their own original research in this area, and all will have the opportunity to attend many other talks and to learn what progress is being made in research in logic across the Americas.  The SLALM, which is held every two to three years, is the pre-eminent conference in logic in Latin America, which has proven over recent decades to be a region of great productivity in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Logic in Latin America does not always focus on the same areas as it does in the US.  There is a heavy concentration of non-classical logicians, especially in South American nations, making it important for external researchers to come to the SLALM in order to keep current on progress in this area.  In contrast, computability theory is much more prominent in the US than in Latin America, and US-based researchers who attend the SLALM will be able to detail and explain recent advances in this area.  Model theory is well represented in Colombia and Costa Rica in particular, as well as in the US, while set theorists are scattered all over the Americas, both North and South.  There have often been fruitful collaborations between US and Latin American scholars in these fields, and we confidently expect this SLALM to produce many more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information is available at https://xxslalm.cmat.edu.uy/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
