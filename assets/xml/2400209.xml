<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms-B (CSDM-B) Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Craig M. Anderson of the Chemistry Program at Bard College is investigating the synthesis and characterization of platinum(IV) species with ligands containing thiophene moieties. Although photoactive platinum compounds exist, this research will focus on platinum(IV) species, as they are understudied compared to their platinum(II) counterparts, and the development of this class of compounds may allow greater tunability of photophysical properties for potential use as sensors or devices. A vital component of this work is that it involves the training of undergraduate students and these students will gain proficiency in the practice of science in a contemporary chemistry laboratory. Undergraduate research students are to be involved in all aspects of the work from performing laboratory experiments to writing scientific articles to giving public presentations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this award, the Bard College team will synthesize and characterize cyclometalated Pt-compounds, which are a multifaceted group of compounds with applications in catalysis, sensors, and artificial photosynthetic devices. Photophysical properties of the cyclometalated platinum(IV) compounds will be characterized. Molecular design strategies to improve their properties, including quantum yield and excited-state lifetime, will be evaluated. These strategies include the use of isocyanide ligands and other strong field ligands. A systematic study will increase knowledge about the relationship between metal/ligand combination, and photophysical properties.  Successful studies here have the potential to provide insight on the development of better devices and sensors using photoactive transition metal complexes. The plan is to target compounds that exhibit dual emission or rigidoluminescence (RL). Dual emission plays important roles in sensing and labeling applications, and RL is of interest because rigid media mimic the environment in devices. The proposed research is expected to increase fundamental knowledge about the relationship between ligand architecture and photophysical properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
