<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate how groundwater discharge delivers important nutrients to the coastal ecosystems of the West Florida Shelf. Preliminary studies indicate that groundwater may supply both dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and iron in this region. In coastal ecosystems like the West Florida Shelf that have very low nitrate and ammonium concentrations, DON is the main form of nitrogen available to organisms. Nitrogen cycling is strongly affected by iron availability because iron is essential for both photosynthesis and for nitrogen fixation. This study will investigate the sources and composition of DON and iron, and their influence on the coastal ecosystem. The team will sample offshore groundwater wells, river and estuarine waters, and conduct two expeditions across the West Florida Shelf in winter and summer. Investigators will participate in K-12 and outreach activities to increase awareness of the project and related science. The project will fund the work of six graduate and eight undergraduate students across five institutions, furthering NSFâ€™s goals of education and training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Motivated by preliminary observations of unexplained, tightly-correlated DON and dissolved iron concentrations across the West Florida Shelf (WFS), the proposed work will quantify the flux and isotopic signatures of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD)-derived DON and iron to the WFS, and evaluate the bioavailability of this temporally-variable source using four seasonal near-shore campaigns sampling offshore groundwater wells, estuarine, and riverine endmembers and two cross-shelf cruises. The work will evaluate whether SGD stimulates nitrogen fixation on the WFS, and the potential for the stimulated nitrogen fixation to further modify the chemistry of DON and dissolved iron in the region. The cross-shelf cruises will investigate hypothesized periods of maximum SGD and Trichodesmium abundance (June), and reduced river discharge and SGD (February), thus comparing two distinct biogeochemical regimes. The concentrations and isotopic compositions of DON and dissolved iron, molecular composition of DON, and the concentration and composition of iron-binding ligands will be characterized. Nitrogen fixation rates and Trichodesmium spp. abundance and expression of iron stress genes will be measured. Fluxes of DON and iron from SGD and rivers will be quantified with radium isotope mass balances. The impacts of SGD on nitrogen fixation and DON/ligand production will be constrained with incubations of natural phytoplankton communities with submarine groundwater amendments. Two hypotheses will be tested: 1) SGD is the dominant source of bioavailable DON and dissolved iron on the WFS, and 2) SGD-alleviation of iron stress changes the dominant Trichodesmium species on the WFS, increases nitrogen fixation rates and modifies DON and iron composition. Overall, the work will establish connections between marine nitrogen and iron cycling and evaluate the potential for coastal inputs to modify water along the WFS before export to the Atlantic Ocean. This study will thus provide a framework to consider these boundary fluxes in oligotrophic coastal systems and the relative importance of rivers and SGD as sources of nitrogen and iron in other analogous locations, such as coastal systems in Australia, India, and Africa, where nitrogen fixation and SGD have also been documented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
