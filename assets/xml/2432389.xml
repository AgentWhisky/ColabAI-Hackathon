<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this I-Corps project is based on the development of novel bacterial strains that enhance plant growth and fruit yields and increase resilience of tomato and pepper plants against attacks by soil-borne pathogens. Novel bacterial strains have potential for widespread use in agriculture due to their ability to enhance plant growth and provide protection against pathogens and environmental stresses. This solution provides an environmentally friendly system for plant growth enhancement and disease management, properties that are particularly needed in organic farming. By increasing locally produced organic vegetables, this solution could potentially lead to a reduction in imported organic produce, while also providing an alternative to chemical pesticides used in conventional farming. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of commercially viable bacterial formulations in powder and liquid forms that can be readily applied by organic farmers. Through rigorous greenhouse and field trials, plants treated with these beneficial bacteria exhibited improved growth and increasing yields by 30 percent compared to the non-treated plants. Unlike traditional chemical pesticides, which often leave detrimental residual effects on produce and microbial communities, these bacteria-based solutions offer a sustainable alternative to benefit the organic production system and meet the increasing demand for safer, chemical-free produce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
