<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support to students from US institutions to participate in the Doctoral Consortium at the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) in Seattle, WA, from June 17 to 21, 2024. CVPR is the premier annual conference in computer vision with over 10,000 senior, junior and student participants from all over the world. The Doctoral Consortium event at the conference is designed specifically for Ph.D. students who are nearing graduation or who have recently graduated, offering them an opportunity to present their research and receive valuable feedback from senior researchers. The event will be in-person and include a poster session, group discussions, and small group mentoring sessions. The grant helps the career development of some of the brightest junior researchers in computer vision, potentially increases the number of active researchers and educators in STEM and plays a significant role in advancing the field of computer vision and finding solutions to complex problems that benefit society as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide travel support to a diverse group of approximately 25 students from US-based institutions, including those from underrepresented groups and institutions and those who may not otherwise have the means to attend the conference. The travel award will partially cover conference-related expenses such as airfare, lodging, and transportation. The selection of participants and travel support recipients will be determined by the 2024 CVPR Doctoral Consortium chairs and will be diverse in terms of gender, ethnic background, academic institution, and geographic location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
