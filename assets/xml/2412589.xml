<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award is to support student travel and participation in the 2024 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Conference on Connected Health: Applications, Systems, Engineering Technologies (CHASE), in Wilmington, Delaware. CHASE is a leading international conference in the field of connected health and aims at offering a unique opportunity for researchers worldwide to exchange innovative ideas and develop collaborations. This award particularly provides a scientific forum for students with substantive potentials in computing and engineering research associated with the multidisciplinary field of connected health. CHASE will offer opportunities for students to receive networking support, research and career advice from internationally recognized experts. This award will make possible the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend and to interact with mentors and peers of varying gender, ethnicity and background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports about 20 students by providing a live Student Research Forum focused on encouraging students to examine technologies from multiple perspectives and understand how innovative technology, advanced analytics, persuasive computing, biomedical expertise and information combined to make the most impact. By participating in technical sessions and panels, students also have opportunities to learn about the research frontiers in the connected health field and interact with senior members of the profession and representatives from industry, academia and federal agencies in this field. In addition, the Career Panel enables students to understand different career paths for researchers in this area. Overall, the CHASE conference exposes student participants to different scientific disciplinary approaches and is designed to support the development of the next generation of scholars in connected health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
