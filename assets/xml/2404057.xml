<AbstractNarration>With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Lisa McElwee White of the University of Florida, and Professor Howard Fairbrother of Johns Hopkins University will explore the underlying reactions involved in two technologically important processes, Focused Electron Beam-Induced Deposition (FEBID) and Extreme UltraViolet Lithography (EUVL). This is a synergistic collaboration between a synthetic chemist and a surface characterization chemist, respectively.  As electronic devices such as smartphones and laptops become smaller but have more capability, it is important to be able to create very precise nanostructured materials with exquisite molecular and spatial control. To continue to improve these technologies it is important to understand the chemical reactions responsible for creating these metal nanostructure so that their physical and chemical properties can be tailored for specific applications. Students involved in this project present their work at scientific meetings, publish papers in peer reviewed journals and participate in lab exchanges. To communicate the excitement of science to the general public, participants in the project are generating a series of 90-second "Tiny Tech" radio modules and podcasts that feature real world applications of chemistry and chemistry-based nanoscience.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;FEBID is a bottom-up, direct-write lithographic process where 3-D nanostructures are created by localized, electron-induced reactions of organometallic precursors adsorbed onto substrates. In contrast, EUVL is a state of the art, top-down lithographic technique where 13.5nm light initiates solubility switching in inorganic photoresists as a route to create nanopatterns for the semiconductor industry. The link between FEBID and EUVL is the role low energy (&lt; 100eV) secondary electrons play in driving the chemical reactions. For FEBID to emerge as a robust nanofabrication technique and to create the next generation of EUVL inorganic photoresists, it is crucial to develop a holistic understanding of electron interactions with organometallic complexes, including identifying key structure-reactivity relationships. To acquire this crucial information, we will use surface science studies that use FEBID precursors and inorganic EUVL resists designed to test hypotheses and/or answer specific questions on the structure-activity relationships for electron-mediated organometallic reactivity. The research effort will be augmented by domestic and international collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
