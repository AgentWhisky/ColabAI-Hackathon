<AbstractNarration>With the rapid rise of generative AI in the early 2020s, there is a growing urgency both within and beyond academia to understand the social and ethical ramifications of this technology across all sectors and fields. However, to date, relatively little attention has been paid to the implications of generative AI technologies for equity and fairness. To address this significant gap, one that could compromise the utility of this powerful technology, the North Carolina Central University School of Law (NCCU) Technology Law and Policy Center convenes the third annual Law &amp; Technology Summit. Spanning two days with provision for both virtual and in-person participation, the Law and Technology Summit addresses the impact of generative AI on healthcare through an equity and justice lens. Related topics examined include the legal frameworks and ethical implications related to other emerging issues, such as privacy, cybersecurity, and intellectual property. This project opens with a one-day Symposium on the topic of Generative AI and Healthcare. The Symposium portion of the summit is a crucial step towards ensuring that the transformative potential of generative AI in healthcare and the broader legal profession is realized with a lens on justice, fairness, and equity. The Symposium provides a platform for a wide range of attendees from fields of technology, law, and health to dissect and debate the complex legal and ethical landscape of generative AI and healthcare, with the aim of identifying and building inclusive and ethically sound applications and approaches. Symposium papers will be published in legal journals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On day two the Summit convenes a similarly diverse cohort of legal scholars and practitioners to unpack broader themes related to Artificial Intelligence and the biases inherent in AI technologies. The Summit will continue to explore the relationship between Generative AI and healthcare while examining the legal frameworks and ethical implications surrounding other emerging issues, including privacy, cybersecurity, and intellectual property. The design of the conference comprises keynote speeches, panel discussions, workshops, and roundtable sessions, all of which serve to foster dialogue among attorneys, legal scholars, sociologists, healthcare professionals, AI technologists, policymakers, ethicists, students, and others. Recordings of the Summit panel discussions and keynotes will be accessible on the NCCU Technology Law and Policy Center website and through additional channels. Emerging researchers, including students, will gain both valuable knowledge of current research and also networking opportunities that will enhance research in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
