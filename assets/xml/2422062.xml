<AbstractNarration>The 17th Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks (ACM WiSec) will be held in Seoul, South Korea from May 27-30, 2024.  This proposal requests $20,000 in funding to assist approximately ten United States-based graduate students to attend WiSec 2024.  WiSec is one of the leading international conferences on the security and privacy of wireless communications and mobile networks. Every year, researchers present novel ideas and fundamental advances in areas including location privacy, anonymity, security of smartphones, jamming attacks and defenses, and usable mobile security. WiSec serves to foster communication among researchers and practitioners with a common interest in improving the security of wireless networks and devices through scientific and technological innovation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participation in conferences such as WiSec is an extremely important part of graduate students' research and career development, providing the opportunity for them to present their own work, attend panel and keynote speech sessions, interact with peers and senior researchers, and expose themselves to leading-edge work in the fields of wireless networks security and mobile privacy. The support requested in this proposal will enable more U.S.-based graduate students to participate in WiSec 2024 than would otherwise be able to attend.  Students will be selected based on their connection and contribution to the WiSec community and their financial need, with an eye toward including students from a wide range of institutional and demographic backgrounds in order to broaden the talent pool available to the cybersecurity community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
