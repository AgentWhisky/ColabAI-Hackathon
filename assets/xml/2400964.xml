<AbstractNarration>Northeastern Junior College (NJC) will connect all facets of renewable energy careers into a common skill set that will enable students to become versatile and flexible employees as they enter the workforce.  The integration of new technologies across disciplines serving the renewable energy sector will give students the opportunity to bridge the gap between wind and solar power generation, and energy storage.  These gaps, identified by NJCâ€™s industry partners, represent the employable set of skills that will enable them to contribute to the local economy.  This project will prepare students for the integration of solar power and battery storage into the existing Automation and Wind Technician program.  Solar panels and battery-based power storage are increasingly common features of wind farms, and this project will ensure that new renewable energy employees are ready for the transition.  NJC seeks to engage new students who are entering the workforce for the first time, as well as existing energy employees who need to improve upon their existing skillset. The transformation of the traditional energy grid to a smart system, that is responsive to the needs of the community, and able to make use of wind and solar power is a priority for Colorado, where NJC operates.  This program will prepare students for secure and high-paying jobs in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A primary goal of this project is to provide professional development for faculty as they deepen their skills in solar power generation and energy storage.  They will do this in consultation with NJC's industry partners.  Additionally, NJC will integrate new curriculum into the existing Industrial Automation and Wind Technology program that will incorporate solar power generation and energy storage technologies.  To attract potential students, an educational outreach program will be created that will include power generation professional development for high school teachers, new educational materials and resources to support high school instruction, and career exploration events for high school students as well as adults.  Results from this project will be shared through the CREATE National Energy Center and at regional and national conferences.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
