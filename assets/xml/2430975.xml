<AbstractNarration>This grant supports student participation at the Thirty-Fifth Annual International Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) Symposium, scheduled for 11-14 August 2024, in Austin, Texas. The SFF Symposium serves as a venue for the exchange of knowledge in the realms of additive, freeform, and hybrid manufacturing. Last year, the event drew participants from over 100 universities, with 70% representing domestic institutions. Notably, student attendees constituted approximately 45% of the 700+ total participants. The 2024 symposium will emphasize new developments in eco-friendly manufacturing processes and the integration of artificial intelligence in additive manufacturing. Additionally, a special session on biomedical applications of additive manufacturing will be featured to enhance interdisciplinary research and collaborations within the field. This year's symposium also features the introduction of a mentoring program, designed to match each student with a mentor from industry, national labs, or academia based on their career goals and interests. This initiative aims to provide personalized guidance and enhance career development opportunities for participants. To foster accessibility and encourage diverse student attendance, the travel award will help cover conference registration fees, accommodations, and travel expenses for qualified students. This initiative aims to lower barriers to entry and ensure a broad representation of ideas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outreach for student support applications will include: (1) direct emails to authors of accepted abstracts, (2) targeted communications to past SFF attendees, (3) announcements on the SFF website, and (4) social media campaigns on platforms like LinkedIn. The selection process, conducted by the conference committee, will prioritize students from U.S. institutions who are actively contributing to the conference through presentations, posters, or participation in competitions. Special consideration is given to students attending for the first time, as part of a commitment to broadening participation and engaging new members of the community. Student awardees will also benefit from exclusive networking opportunities, including a luncheon panel that discusses current research trends and potential career paths in additive manufacturing. This award aims to equip emerging leaders with a comprehensive global outlook, exposure to innovative ideas, and insight into future industry challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
